# Image Processing: Primary Concept Practice #
## RGB to Grayscale Conversion ##
1. First a RGB image has been taken.
2. Have separated the red green and blue values into three different matrices.
3. Average of these three matrices has been calculated.
4. Then calculated average matrix has been converted into integer matrix.
5. For each pixel for a threshold value of 127 is taken and entire grayscale image has been converted into binary image.
